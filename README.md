# Focus colors for VIM

This is mostly a copy of the default [quiet colorscheme](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/colors/quiet.vim)

Just install it like any other plugin.
For example with vim-plug:
```
Plug 'roelandm/vim-focus'
```

Activate it in .vimrc:
```
set termguicolors
set background=dark
colorscheme focus
```

Use [colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) to change the colors.
